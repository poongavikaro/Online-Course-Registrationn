## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (v14 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **MongoDB** - [Download here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) or use MongoDB Atlas
3. **Google Cloud Account** - For OAuth setup

## üì¶ Installation

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd client && npm install && cd ..
```

### Step 2: Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# MongoDB Configuration
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/course_registration

# Google OAuth Configuration (Get from Google Cloud Console)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_here

# Security Keys (Generate secure random strings)
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret_here

# URLs
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Admin Configuration
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin-email@gmail.com
```

### Step 3: Google OAuth Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the **Google+ API**
4. Go to **Credentials** ‚Üí **Create Credentials** ‚Üí **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs**
5. Set Application type to **Web application**
6. Add these Authorized redirect URIs:
   - `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/google/callback`
   - `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/google/callback` (for production)
7. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** to your `.env` file

### Step 4: Database Setup

```bash
# Make sure MongoDB is running, then seed the database
node scripts/seedData.js
```

This will create **16 sample courses** across all departments:
- **Computer Science**: Programming, Web Development, AI/ML, Data Science
- **Engineering**: Project Management, Cloud Computing with AWS
